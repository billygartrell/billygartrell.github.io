    <h1 class="tk-roboto-mono">good morning,</h1>
    <p class="tk-roboto-mono">I was planning on writing about something else this week, but my mind has been a little lost and scattered recently, so I think I need to dive into that a little bit deeper. I want to write about love and how sometimes I get quite scared of it.<br><br>
      Earlier this week you told me, "I believe in love."<br><br>
      I was so relieved.<br><br>
      I've spent a lot of my life thinking. I'm not sure if it's a side affect of being an only child or if it's just something that's simply a part of me, but I let my mind circle things a lot. Honestly, probably too much at times. I can dwell on things and really let them eat me up. I've tried to work on that a lot throughout my life, and I think I'm getting better. Anyway, one of the things that I think about frequently are my morals and stance on religion. What is this whole life thing? Why do people do the things they do? Why do things make me feel so good? Why do things hurt me so much? Despite all of the things that go through my head, I come back to one thing: love. I'm not sure if I belive in an all powerful ruler who created us, but I believe in the things that I've felt. I believe in the connection between people and ultimately, I follow that.<br><br>
      Even though that's one of the things that shapes my life the most, it is also one of the most complicated and confusing things that I can think of and there are days where I just get lost in it. I'm lost in my head and I get stuck there until I go to sleep. I feel uncomfortable. I feel sadness behind my eyes. I feel tired. It's so bizarre. Sometimes, I don't even know what triggers it. It kind of just happens.<br><br>
      I have a tendency to get lost in the past. I think of good a bad times of love throughout my life and it all brings the emotions back. The happiness and the sadness. Like a computer that has way too much open, my brain just starts to freeze and I get lost in this mix of emotions for hours. I don't really think of one particular thing, but all of it.<br><br>
      I've been really hurt before. You know this. Unfortunately, it left a scar on me that I try not to open often. It still happens, and it will happen and I'm so thankful for your support. I just get worried about my past mistakes, things that maybe I wasn't good enough at, and that I might mess up again in the future. It's usually all really absurd thought processes, but it's just how it goes when I can't get out of it.<br><br>
      I've told you about this passage before, but I want to show it off again here:</p>
      <p class="quote tk-karmina">
        Twisting and turning beside the slumbering Tereza, he recalled something she had told him a long time before in the course of an insignificant conversation. They had been talking about his friend Z, when she announced, 'If I hadn't met you, I'd certainly have fallen in love with him.'

Even then, her words had left Tomas in a strange state of melancholy, and now he realized it was only a matter of chance that Tereza loved him and not his friend Z. Apart from her consummated love for Tomas, there were, in the realm of possibility, an infinite number of unconsummated loves for other men
We all reject out of hand the idea that the love of our life may be something light or weightless; we presume our love is what must be, that without it our life would no longer be the same; we feel Beethoven himself, gloomy and awe-inspiring, is playing to our own great love.</p>

      <p class="tk-roboto-mono">
        I discovered it through the song "Please Remember" by Deafheaven, if you want to take a listen to it.<br><br>
        I don't know if love comes down to chance, but I think it's an interesting thought to explore. I put so much weight and importance on love, that I don't think it's possible! There has to be something special behind it. Even so, it really might just be all a coincidenceâ€”and in that, there is beauty as well. Of ALL of the possibilites that could have happened in the world, we were in the right place at the right time. There's definitely beauty there too. So, I feel like this quote can be taken both ways. It's negative. It's positive. It really reflects the gray area that my mind rests in most times.<br><br>
        Man, I don't really know what I'm talking about right now. I'm kind of just rambling about thoughts and feelings that I haven't explored enough to really talk about. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think love is a beautiful thing. It is powerful and something that drives most actions of my life. I want to be loved. I want to be cared for. But at the same time, I want to reciproocate for someone else. It makes me feel whole. I don't think that I'm too good when I'm on my own. I don't feel like I have as much of a direction or purpose.<br><br>
        I want these messages to be well thought out and contain a bunch of meaningful things, but I think that for this one I need to leave it messy. It's a better representation of what I think about despite being a little more taxing to read.<br><br>
        Despite the occasional bad "trip-down-memory-lane," I love love. It's amazing. Thank you for understanding what I go through sometimes. The remedy: a little alone time, a good night's sleep, and a good conversation soon after.<br><br>
        I think that's all I have in me for this one.</p>
        <h2 class="tk-roboto-mono">Love, B</h2>
