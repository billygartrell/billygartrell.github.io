    So, I've been thinking: There's a lot that's involved with getting to know someone. There are so many little stories and thoughts that are buried in my head after 23 years on this planet. Even though we've talked hundereds of times at this point, there are always little things that come and go. I thought that this might be a fun way to tell you about some things that I think about. This is raw, baby. This is straight from my head.<br><br>
  A few years ago, during my senior year of high school, I had this really great teacher named Mr. Kozicki that turned my young mind onto the idea of "morning pages." It's a cool ideal where you write three pages in a notebook every morning, no matter what. It's a way for your brain to do some mental dust-busting before you begin the day. No matter what you're thinking about, you write it down. I really enjoyed doing this exercise and since then I have bursts of doing it daily and then going on a hiatus for a while. It's a struggle, but I try. I'm simply too bad at forming habits to <i>really</i> do it every day.<br><br>
There's this place that my mind goes when I'm really thinking about something. I don't know what it's called or really how to describe it. It's this deep-thought where I can just tell that I'm really in-tune with myself. It takes a while to get into, but once I'm there, I just feel it. I like when my brain gets to this place. I feel like the things that I think of are more vivid; the words I write, more interesting. I don't know. All I know is that it's a place that I want to get to more often. Since meeting you I've felt inspired. I feel this drive to continue to make and to think about my life differently. I don't think I've had such a valuable feeling as that in a very long time. It's truly incredible and I'm so thankful for it. So I guess what I'm trying to say, is that I want to <i>think</i> using a medium that I want to learn more about. Obviously, that's through web and digital design. With this, I can control the layout, <span style="font-family:serif;">change the fonts</span>, and <span style="color:red;">make it look perty.</span> I think it's a way for me to tell you about my brain, and I can have fun editing things and making stuff look weird in the meantime. Writing is really beautiful, and it's something that I've always wanted to explore a little more.<br><br>
I have some topics in mind, but I'm going to save them for the near future.</p><br>
